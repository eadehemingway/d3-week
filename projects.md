The best way to start building a d3 chart is to find an existing example and play around with the code until you understand it, and then you can adapt it to your needs.
Have a look at the [d3 gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery) to see what sort of graphs are possible. 

[Here](https://github.com/eadehemingway/d3-simple-charts) is a repo that has some examples of simple d3 graphs. 
Clone the repo, have a look through and choose which chart you want to make for your project. 

Once you feel you understand the code for the example you are following, try to build your own version of the graph without looking too much at the example. 
There are always multiple ways of building the same graph so it is always good to look at a few different examples to get a good understanding of what the options are.

Your project should have extra features added ontop of the basic graphs seen in this repo 
a few suggested extra features: 

- tooltips
- drag functionality 
- abitlity to change the data and for the graph to update when the data has changed
- ability to zoom into the graph 
- ability to hide parts or show parts of the graph
- buttons that allow the user to control the look of the graph

Start off using dummy data, and if you have time replace it with real world data!
